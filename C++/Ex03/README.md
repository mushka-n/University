# **Ex03** Exploring C and C ++ Library Sorting Techniques


## Explanation

### Step 1

Investigation of a program that measures the running time of the qsort function and the sort algorithm from the standard library

### Step 2

Performing at least 50 measurements for an array of different lengths and determining the dependence of the execution time on the size of the array using the program from **Step 1**

### Step 3

Plot the function graphs for **qsort** and **sort** using the accumulated data and comment them out. 


## Composition of the program

> - **task1.h** - header file containing the **comp** function
> - **task1.cpp** - file containing the implementation of functions
> - **main1.cpp** - file containing **main**
> - **results.png** - file with graphs
> - **results.txt** - output file
