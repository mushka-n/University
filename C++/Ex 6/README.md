# Ex06 Development of the simplest classes


## Explanation

The Prime class (prime number) is representing and storing prime numbers. It is provided by the following methods:

> - **void setValue (int)** - set the number
> - **bool isValid ()** - checking whether the set number is really simple
> - **bool checkPrime(int)** - checking the passed number for simplicity
> - **int countBetween(Prime&)** - counting the number of primes between the set and transmitted
> - **Prime nextPrime ()** - returns a prime number located after the set
> - **int getValue ()** - returns the set number.

## Composition of the program

> - **Prime.h** is the header file for the **Prime**class.
> - **Prime.cpp** - a file with the implementation of methods of the **Prime * * class.
> - **main.cpp** - pre-installation program for working with the **Prime**class.
